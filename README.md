# Project Databaze
This is my project for DFEW10 cohort implementing Sprint and MySQL database. We were tasked with creating an application in one week that fulfills a criterior and utilises MySQL database. I expect this project to be very challenging given the short one week timescale, but looking forward to see how far I can go.

The project is in bare bones form at present, over the next few days I will begin add the basic files and start fleshing out the project.

Day 1/ I added the controller. service and repo files and add in the database connection and entries.

Day 2/ Over the next couple of days, I got the the basics of the project together and started testing.


Day 3/ This is a screen shot of the application running with Postman software posting, getting updating and deleting to and from the data base.

Here is a screen shot of the MySQL data base setup and running from the application with persistent data: -

Day 4 There are lots of tests done, but loads more to go yet! I am finding the tests very challenging.

The data can be sent from Postman to the application and then through to the database or retrieved from the data base and queried through the apllication.

Throughout the project, I have been working on the development commits of the application and then merging the branches at regular intevals when it is safe or appropriate to do so.

After some wasted time with a problem between the Eclipse schema and MySQL, finally testing is going well  !!!
