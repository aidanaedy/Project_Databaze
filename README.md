# Project_Databaze
This is my project for DFEW10 cohort implementing Sprint and MySQL database

The project is in bare bones form at present, over the next few days I will begin add the basic files and start fleshing out the project.

Day 1/ I added the controller. service and repo files and add in the database connection and entries.

Day 2 + 3/ Over the next couple of days, I got the the basics of the project together and started testing.
